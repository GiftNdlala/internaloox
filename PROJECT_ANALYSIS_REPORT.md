## üõ† Technical Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions Required**

#### A. Create Inventory Management Models
```python
# New models needed:
- Material (name, type, unit, current_stock, min_stock, max_stock)
- MaterialCategory (fabric, foam, wood, accessories, packaging)
- MaterialVariant (colors, sizes, specifications)
- StockMovement (in/out tracking)
- Supplier (contact info, pricing)
- MaterialSupplier (relationship with pricing)
```

#### B. Create Task Management System
```python
# New models needed:
- Task (assigned_to, order, material_required, status, priority)
- TaskType (cutting, sewing, assembly, quality_check)
- TaskStatus (not_started, in_progress, completed, paused)
- TaskNote (comments, issues, time_spent)
```

#### C. Extend Current Order System
```python
# Modifications needed:
- OrderMaterial (link orders to required materials)
- MaterialAllocation (reserve materials for orders)
- ProductionTask (link tasks to orders and materials)
```

### 2. **Database Schema Extensions**

#### New Tables Required:
1. `inventory_material`
2. `inventory_materialcategory`
3. `inventory_materialvariant`
4. `inventory_stockmovement`
5. `inventory_supplier`
6. `inventory_materialsupplier`
7. `tasks_task`
8. `tasks_tasktype`
9. `tasks_tasknote`
10. `orders_ordermaterial`
11. `orders_materialallocation`

### 3. **API Endpoints to Develop**

#### Inventory Management:
- `/api/materials/` (CRUD)
- `/api/materials/low-stock/` (alerts)
- `/api/materials/usage-report/` (analytics)
- `/api/suppliers/` (CRUD)
- `/api/stock-movements/` (tracking)

#### Task Management:
- `/api/tasks/` (CRUD)
- `/api/tasks/assign/` (assignment)
- `/api/tasks/my-tasks/` (worker view)
- `/api/tasks/notifications/` (supervisor alerts)

### 4. **Frontend Components to Build**

2. ‚úÖ Prioritize features based on business needs
3. ‚úÖ Begin Phase 1 development planning
4. ‚úÖ Set up development environment for inventory system

### **Client Decisions Needed:**
1. **Material Stock Levels**: Define minimum/maximum stock levels for each material type
2. **Supplier Information**: Provide supplier contact details and pricing
3. **Task Workflow**: Confirm exact task types and workflow steps
4. **Reporting Requirements**: Specify which reports are most critical

### **Technical Preparations:**
1. Create new Django app for inventory management
2. Design database schema for materials and tasks
3. Plan API endpoint structure
4. Design UI mockups for new features

## üìû Conclusion

The current OOX Warehouse Dashboard has a **solid foundation** with excellent order management, user authentication, and basic product tracking. However, it's missing the **core inventory management and task assignment systems** that the client specifically needs.

The gap is significant but manageable with focused development effort. The existing architecture is well-designed and can accommodate the required extensions without major refactoring.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 development immediately, focusing on core inventory management features that will provide immediate value to the client's daily operations.
